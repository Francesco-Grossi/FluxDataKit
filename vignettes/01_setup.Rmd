# Setup

Install all critical packages required in gathering and processing the data by
installing the `FluxDataKit` package.

```r
devtools::install_github(
  "geco-bern/FluxDataKit"
)
```

In addition clone the project as we'll need some additional scripts which are
only available in the source code of the project (see data provenance below).

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/geco-bern/FluxDataKit.git
```

With all tools installed we need to download the required input data for
aggregation.

# data provenance (downloads)

A list of numbered scripts is provided in the `data-raw` directory of the cloned
project, and which govern the downloading and compiling of intermediate data. 
The numbered scripts should be run in sequence. All code is written in `R` and
should be executed in the project environment of the `FluxDataKit` package
(i.e. open the FluxDataKit.proj file in RStudio or make sure you have set the
topmost directory to the project folder).

Due to login-walls, or missing API infrastructure, most data downloads are still
manual instead of automated. The below section therefore links to the locations
where you can manually get the data. No fixes will be provided to facilitate this
process further.

By default the data will be downloaded to a directory with the `data-raw/`
base path. Before running any scripts, check if data is written to this directory.
When you want to alter the storage location you may use soft links.

## Meta data

Meta-data is compiled on a site by site basis using the
`01_collect_meta-data.R` script. This will compile all easily available
meta-data through either API calls or scraping the data downloaded in the
previous step (setup / data collection). In the current scirpt paths are set
for data stored in `data-raw`. However, you are free to move the data anywhere
you like as long as you adjust the paths in the meta-data script.

```r
source("data-raw/01_collect_meta-data.R")
```

Given the various datasets, and at times overlap between the datasets a priority
in processing is given to more recent (hopefully) and more complete datasets. In
order of processing this means that OneFlux has priority over FLUXNET2015, and 
Plumber2. ICOS data has priority over FLUXNET2015 for European sites. Overall, 
Plumber2 mostly fills in the remaining sites in Asia and Australia. The final
picking order is specified and processed by calling the below script.

```r
source("data-raw/02_compile_final_site_list.R")
```

## Flux data

All ecosystem flux sources should be downloaded at half-hourly (HH) rates. Data 
sources and final paths are listed below. Top level paths for flux data are 
considered to be sufficient for further processing.

Estimated data sizes are provided to indicate network load, although for most
these downloads should be easily manageable from a download and storage perspective.
Below you find a summary table of data volumes, nr. of sites and the local storage
paths for all flux data products considered.

| product   |      data volume      |  nr. sites |  data path |
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|:------|
| FLUXNET2015 |  ~35GB | 166 | `data-raw/flux_data/fluxnet2015/`
| ICOS | ~12GB   |  67  | `data-raw/flux_data/icos/`
| Ameriflux OneFlux | ~12GB | 74 | `data-raw/flux_data/oneflux/`
| Plumber2 | ~4GB | 112 | `data-raw/flux_data/plumber_fluxnet/`

### FLUXNET2015

FLUXNET2015 data is downloaded from the dedicated 
[download page](https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/). A login is 
required to access the data. We only considered the legacy **FULLSET** data, 
which is covered by a CC-BY 4.0 license. This limits the site count. Expanding 
this list is possible, but only with permission from the PI sharing the data. 
We refer to the [data policy](https://fluxnet.org/data/data-policy/) for more
details.

### ICOS

As of writing ICOS data was provided as a pre-release to our group and is therefore not
yet available for a wider public. However, this data should be released shortly through
the [ICOS carbon portal](https://www.icos-cp.eu/data-services/about-data-portal).

### Ameriflux OneFlux

A limited set of sites has been reprocessed using the Ameriflux OneFlux processing chain.
The data should be downloaded manually from the [website data portal](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/login/?redirect_to=/data/download-data/). A
login is required.

### Plumber2

"PLUMBER2 is a model inter-comparison project for land surface models. Multiple 
leading land surface and ecosystem models are evaluated for water and carbon fluxes
at 170 flux tower sites, spanning multiple biomes and climate zones globally." 
the full description of the dataset can be found in the publication by 
[Ukkola et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-181) and combines 
FLUXNET2015, La Thuile and OzFlux collections.

The downloading and conversion is facilitated using a script 
`00_download_convert_flux_data.R` included in the `data-raw` directory.

## Gridded products

Other gridded data products are required to complement the flux data for modelling
purposes. Products required, data volumes and storage paths are listed below.
Detailed links to original publications and data are provided below.

| product   |      data volume      |  data path |
|-----------|:---------------------:|:-----------|
| rooting zone water storage |  ~80MB | `data-raw/ancillary_data/rooting_zone_water_storage/`
| Koeppen-Geiger |  ~22MB | `data-raw/ancillary_data/koeppen_geiger/`
| field capacity |  ~4MB | `data-raw/ancillary_data/field_capacity/`

### Rooting zone water storage capacity

Global rooting zone water storage capacity can be
[downloaded here](https://zenodo.org/record/5515246) (Stocket et al. 2020).

### Koeppen-Geiger (included in repo)

Koeppen-Geiger climate classifications are downloaded from the recent
work by [Beck et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018214). Data
can be downloaded from the [project website](http://www.gloh2o.org/koppen/) but
is also included in the repository due to its small size.

### Field capacity (included in repo)

Global Gridded Surfaces of Selected Soil Characteristics on the [ORNL DAAC](
https://daac.ornl.gov/SOILS/guides/IGBP-SurfaceProducts.html) provides field
capacity values. Data needs to be manually downloaded from the [visualization
tools](https://webmap.ornl.gov/ogc/dataset.jsp?ds_id=569) for easy export into
a geotiff format. A ORNL login is required!

## Remote sensing data

### MODISTools

MODIS data can be gathered for offline processing (recommended) using the
`fdk_download_modis()` function. This function takes a list of sites and
meta-data to download the required data using the `MODISTools` package.

With the site list generated or manually populated you can download the data
stored in the `data-raw/modis/` directory as:

```r
sites <- readRDS("data/flux_data_kit_site-info.rds")

fdk_download_modis(
  df = sites,
  path = "data-raw/modis/"
)
```

Consider that this will take a while and is preferably wrapped in a script
to be executed in the background. For one off sites the above method is valid.
For batch processing we refer tot the `04_download_modis_data.R` script in the 
`data-raw` directory.

### FluxnetEO

To supplement the land surface model driver data, and the derived p-model (rsofun)
input, we used the `FluxnetEO` product (Walther et al. 2022) and similarly named 
[package](https://geco-bern.github.io/FluxnetEO/).

Data is provided as [zipped archives](https://meta.icos-cp.eu/collections/tEAkpU6UduMMONrFyym5-tUW) 
and total considerable amounts of data, which requires ample storage space. 
The MODIS dataset has a compressed size of ~32 GB, which results in an uncompressed 
size of ~68 GB. The LandSat dataset exceeds 150 GB compressed 
(this data will currently not be considered).
