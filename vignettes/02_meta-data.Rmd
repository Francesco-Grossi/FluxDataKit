Meta-data is compiled on a site by site basis using the
`01_collect_meta-data.R` script. This will compile all easily available
meta-data through either API calls or scraping the data downloaded in the
previous step (setup / data collection).

```r
source("data-raw/01_collect_meta-data.R")
```

Given the various datasets, and at times overlap between the datasets a priority
in processing is given to more recent (hopefully) and more complete datasets. In
order of processing this means that OneFlux has priority over FLUXNET2015, and 
Plumber2. ICOS data has priority over FLUXNET2015 for European sites. Overall, 
Plumber2 mostly fills in the remaining sites in Asia and Australia. The final
picking order is thus:

```r
source("data-raw/02_compile_final_site_list.R")
```
