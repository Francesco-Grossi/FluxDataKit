## Time series

For time series modelling and analysing long-term trends, we want complete sequences of good-quality data. Data gaps are not an option as they would break sequences. We have to allow for the reduced quality of gap-filled data. But we have to set limits. FluxDataKit contains information about sequences of good-quality gap-free time series for each site for variables gross primary production, the  latent heat flux, and the energy-balance corrected latent heat flux.

This vignette demonstrates the use of this information for obtaining good-quality GPP sequences for which the following criteria apply:

- At least 25% of the half-hourly data used for creating daily aggregates is measured or good-quality gap-filled data (QC flag > 0.5).
- The maximum gap of data after applying the above QC flag is 90 days.
- Retain only data for full years (starting 1 Jan and ending 31 Dec).
- Exclude croplands and wetlands.
- Each site should provide a full sequence (after applying above criteria) with at least three full years' data. 

Information considering points 1-3 are contained in the data frame `fdk_site_fullyearsequence` which is provided as part of the FluxDataKit package.

### Determine sites

Apply criteria listed above.

```{r}
sites <- FluxDataKit::fdk_site_info |>
  dplyr::filter(!(sitename %in% c("MX-Tes", "US-KS3"))) |>  # failed sites
  dplyr::filter(!(igbp_land_use %in% c("CRO", "WET"))) |> 
  left_join(
    fdk_site_fullyearsequence,
    by = "sitename"
  ) |> 
  filter(!drop_gpp) |>  # where no full year sequence was found
  filter(nyears_gpp >= 3)
```

Ths yields 142 sites with a total of 1208 years' data, corresponding to 399,310 data points of daily data.
```{r}
sum(sites$nyears_gpp)
```

### Load data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
path <- "~/data/FluxDataKit/FLUXDATAKIT_FLUXNET/"  # adjust for your own local use

read_onesite <- function(site, path){
  filename <- list.files(path = path, 
                        pattern = paste0("FLX_", site, "_FLUXDATAKIT_FULLSET_DD"), 
                        full.names = TRUE
                        )
  out <- read_csv(filename) |> 
    mutate(sitename = site)
  return(out)
}

# read all daily data for the selected sites
ddf <- purrr::map_dfr(
  sites$sitename,
  ~read_onesite(., path)
)
```

## Select data sequences

Cut to full-year sequences of good-quality data based on FluxDataKit data object `fdk_site_fullyearsequence`. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ddf <- ddf |>
  left_join(
    sites |> 
      select(
        sitename, 
        year_start = year_start_gpp, 
        year_end = year_end_gpp),
    by = join_by(sitename)
  ) |> 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(TIMESTAMP)) |> 
  filter(year >= year_start & year <= year_end) |> 
  dplyr::select(-year_start, -year_end, -year)
```


## Plot

Visualise data availability and quality
```{r, fig.height=25}
sites |> 
  select(
    sitename, 
    year_start = year_start_gpp, 
    year_end = year_end_gpp) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = sitename, 
             xmin = year_start, 
             xmax = year_end)) +
  geom_linerange() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position="top") +
  labs(title = "Good data sequences",
       y = "Site")
```
